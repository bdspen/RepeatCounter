1) Test if program will return input. The program will only be
returning the user input. This is the simplest way  to test that the program
is getting input and returning an output. A single character is also the simplest
string to match.
Input: $input = "a";
Output: $output = "a";

2)Test if the program will count single string matching inputs and return a count.
This will be testing wether the program can count a match as 1.
Input: $input_one = "a";
       $input_two = "a";
Output: $output = "1";

Test if the program can handle upper or mixed case entries.
Input: $input_one = "a";
       $input_two = "A";
Output: "1"

4)Test if the program can match the user word with multiple word entries.
Input: $input_one = "a";
       $input_two = "A car drives down the road"
Output: "1"

5)Test if the program can make multiple matches.
Input: $input_one = "a";
       $input_two = "A car drives down a road called a street";
Output: "3";
